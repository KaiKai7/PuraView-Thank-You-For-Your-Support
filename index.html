  <p>Thank you for supporting me through the usage of my app PuraView. I created this app when I realized that I am pretty good at tech stuff, but finding out what was in my water was hard even for me.</p>
  <p>I looked for an app that could tell me, and discovered that there isn't one. And around this point I almost gave up, and I assume others would also.</p>
  <p>So I spent countless hours figuring out how to make sense of all the data that was available. And then spent even more time creating PuraView.</p>
  <p>Through trial and error, I think I have brought together much of what I originally sought after.</p>
  <p>And that is a simple, easy way to know what was found in my drinking water.</p>
  <p>I thought about making this app ad-supported to help me continue to develop this and other similar projects.</p>
  <p>But doing all this work to make it easy to view your water quality, and then hindering the ability to view it, didn't make sense.</p>
  <p>So instead of ads for everybody, I have decided to include no ads and make PuraView free for all.</p>
  <p>A voluntary donation to <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/calibluesea">Buy Me A Coffee</a> can be made, which will help me continue to develop PuraView and allow PuraView to remain ad-free.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your support!</p>
